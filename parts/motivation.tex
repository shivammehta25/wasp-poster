Natural speech is varied in nature and differs from person to person. Every individual has a different way of speaking the same text. Regressing towards the mean results in flat and dull prosody resulting in unnatural sounding synthesis. To solve this issue we need probabilistic synthesis that can define a distribution over spoken utterances thus, generating more lively speech. Moreover, aligning text and speech is a challenging problem in TTS systems which is currently dominated by attention. But attention in neural TTS systems is not monotonic, it is slow to train, it can break down into gibberish, and it requires a substantial amount of data to work. Different methods have been proposed\textsuperscript{[1, 3]} to replace attention in neural TTS systems with HMMs. We investigate the use of neural HMMs to align the text and speech more robustly \textsuperscript{[2]}
 to get the best of both words. Further, we use normalising flows to learn a distribution over the spoken utterances and sample probabilistically.
