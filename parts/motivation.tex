Natural speech is varied in nature and differs from person to person. Every individual has a different way of speaking the exact text. Regressing towards mean results in flat and dull prosody resulting in unnatural sounding synthesis. To solve this issue and generating more lively speech we need probabilistic synthesis that can define a distribution over spoken utterances. Moreover, Aligning text and speech is a challenging problem in TTS systems, this field is currently dominated by attention. But attention in neural TTS systems is not monotonic, is slow to train, can break down into gibberish, and requires a substantial amount of data to work at all. There has been work\textsuperscript{[1, 3]} to replace attention in neural TTS systems with HMMs. We investigate the use of neural HMMs to align the text and speech more robustly \textsuperscript{[2]}
 to get the best of both words. Further, we use normalising flows to learn a distribution over the spoken utterances and sample probabilistically.
